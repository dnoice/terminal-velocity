✒ Description:
    Typography-focused banner concepts for Terminal Velocity. The letterforms
    themselves embody velocity — falling, accelerating, approaching impact.
    Subtle visual elements support but never overwhelm the type. These are
    banner/header images where the words ARE the visual.

✒ Key Features:
    - Feature 1: Six typography-first banner concepts
    - Feature 2: Letterforms as kinetic objects
    - Feature 3: Subtle environmental elements supporting motion
    - Feature 4: "4" palette integrated into type treatment
    - Feature 5: Multiple aspect ratios for different placements
    - Feature 6: Motion conveyed through type design, not illustration

# TERMINAL VELOCITY — Typography Banner Prompts

> *The words themselves must fall.*

**Core Principle:** Typography is the hero. The letterforms of "TERMINAL VELOCITY" embody the concept — they are falling, accelerating, crossing thresholds. Background elements are subtle, atmospheric, supportive. The type does the work.

## BANNER 01: THE DROP

### Concept
The word "TERMINAL" sits solid at the top. Below it, "VELOCITY" is falling — each letter at a different stage of descent, the Y closest to the bottom, the V still near the top. The letters leave soft white motion trails. The deeper they fall, the more motion blur. The bottom of the frame hints at ground — a faint horizon line or grid.

### Prompt
```
Typographic banner, dark deep slate background (#2e3c44). The word "TERMINAL" 
in bold condensed sans-serif, solid white (#f5f5f4), anchored at the top of 
frame, stable and sharp. Below it, the word "VELOCITY" with each letter falling 
independently — the V highest, each subsequent letter lower, the Y nearest the 
bottom edge. Letters are slightly rotated as if tumbling. Each falling letter 
trails a soft vertical motion blur upward, like a comet tail, fading from white 
to transparent. The lower letters show subtle burnt orange (#ff9e54) heat glow 
on their edges, suggesting friction from speed. At the very bottom of frame: 
a faint horizontal line suggesting ground/horizon, with barely visible grid 
marks in muted electric green (#46ff84). The overall composition suggests 
the word itself is in freefall. Clean, minimal, typographic. Banner aspect 
ratio 3:1.
```

### Subtle Elements
- Faint grid at bottom (approaching ground)
- Motion blur trails on falling letters
- Heat glow intensifying on lower letters
- Possible: tiny altitude numbers descending along right edge, barely visible

### Aspect Ratio
3:1 (wide banner)

## BANNER 02: IMPACT TYPOGRAPHY

### Concept
"TERMINAL VELOCITY" as if the letters just HIT the ground. Impact crater radiating from the text. Letters slightly embedded, dust/particles still settling. The moment of arrival after the fall. Typography as crash site.

### Prompt
```
Typographic banner, the words "TERMINAL VELOCITY" in heavy bold sans-serif, 
white (#f5f5f4), positioned at the lower third of frame as if they have just 
impacted a surface. The letters are slightly embedded into a deep slate 
(#2e3c44) ground plane, with hairline cracks radiating outward from the text 
like impact fractures. Fine particles and dust in burnt orange (#ff9e54) and 
gold (#ffd144) are suspended in the air above the letters, still settling 
from the impact. Subtle motion blur on the particles suggests they're still 
moving upward from the force. The ground surface has a faint grid texture. 
Above the text: empty dark space where the letters fell from. Dramatic 
top-down lighting creates sharp shadows beneath the embedded letters. The 
overall effect is forensic — this is the crash site of a word. Clean, minimal, 
the typography IS the event. Wide banner format.
```

### Subtle Elements
- Impact fractures radiating from letterforms
- Settling dust particles (burnt orange, gold)
- Sharp shadows suggesting depth of impact
- Empty space above = the distance fallen

### Aspect Ratio
3:1 or 4:1 (wide banner)

## BANNER 03: VELOCITY BLUR

### Concept
"TERMINAL" is sharp and readable. "VELOCITY" is pure horizontal motion blur — the word stretched into streaks, moving so fast it's barely legible. The contrast between static and kinetic. Speed as typography treatment.

### Prompt
```
Typographic banner on deep slate background (#2e3c44). The word "TERMINAL" 
in clean, sharp, bold monospace type, soft white (#f5f5f4), perfectly legible, 
positioned left of center. To its right, connected or adjacent: the word 
"VELOCITY" rendered as extreme horizontal motion blur — the letters stretched 
into parallel streaks moving right, barely readable, pure speed. The blur 
transitions from solid letterforms on the left edge of "VELOCITY" to pure 
streaks on the right, as if the word is accelerating out of frame. The motion 
blur streaks carry hints of burnt orange (#ff9e54) at their leading edges 
(friction heat) and fade to electric green (#46ff84) data-stream tones at 
their trailing edges. Subtle: faint speed lines in the background, barely 
perceptible. The contrast is sharp: TERMINAL (still, readable, anchor) vs 
VELOCITY (motion, blur, speed). Minimal, typographic, kinetic.
```

### Subtle Elements
- Speed lines in background (very faint)
- Color shift in blur: orange leading edge, green trailing
- Sharp/blur contrast IS the concept

### Aspect Ratio
4:1 (ultrawide banner) or 3:1

## BANNER 04: ALTIMETER TYPE

### Concept
"TERMINAL VELOCITY" treated like an altimeter readout — the kind you see in a cockpit, with rolling number drums. The letters are mechanical, industrial, as if on rotating drums. A red line or threshold marker sits at a critical point. The type IS the instrument.

### Prompt
```
Typographic banner designed as a mechanical altimeter or odometer readout. 
The words "TERMINAL VELOCITY" displayed as if on rotating drum counters — 
each letter on its own drum, with partial letterforms visible above and 
below suggesting the drums are in motion, rolling. The drums are rendered 
in deep slate (#2e3c44) metal with soft white (#f5f5f4) letters engraved 
or printed on them. Subtle reflections and bevels give the drums dimension. 
A horizontal red/burnt orange (#ff9e54) threshold line or marker sits just 
below the main reading, with small gold (#ffd144) warning triangles at each 
end. The housing around the drums is industrial, riveted, worn — brushed 
steel with slight patina. Behind the drums, barely visible: the next letters 
rolling into place (suggesting continuous descent). Subtle electric green 
(#46ff84) backlight glow behind the drums. The overall effect: the word 
itself is a measurement device, and the measurement is critical. 
Industrial typography.
```

### Subtle Elements
- Drum rotation implies continuous motion/change
- Threshold marker creates tension
- Industrial housing (rivets, wear, patina)
- Green backlight suggesting instrumentation

### Aspect Ratio
3:1 or 5:2 (wide banner)

## BANNER 05: FALLING THROUGH DATA

### Concept
"TERMINAL VELOCITY" in large type, but the letters are windows — through them, you see cascading data streams falling. The letterforms are cut-outs revealing the velocity beneath. The type contains the concept.

### Prompt
```
Typographic banner with "TERMINAL VELOCITY" in massive bold sans-serif 
letterforms that act as windows or masks. The letters are cut out of a 
solid deep slate (#2e3c44) foreground, revealing through them a background 
of vertically cascading data: numbers, graphs, metrics streaming downward 
in electric green (#46ff84) and soft white (#f5f5f4), moving at high speed, 
motion-blurred. The data visible through each letter is falling — scrolling 
rapidly downward. The letter edges are sharp and solid, creating strong 
contrast against the kinetic data within. Subtle: the data streams include 
recognizable fragments — "CO2", temperature readings, years, percentages — 
all falling too fast to fully read. The solid slate area around the letters 
has very faint grid lines. Beneath the main text, a small tagline in teal 
(#44cca4): "Filed under: Causes of Death, Preventable" — static, readable, 
grounding. Minimal frame, maximum type impact.
```

### Subtle Elements
- Recognizable data fragments within letterforms (CO2, temps, years)
- Faint grid on solid areas
- Tagline as static anchor beneath kinetic headline
- Letters as portals to the falling information

### Aspect Ratio
3:1 (wide banner) or 2:1

## BANNER 06: THE FOUR

### Concept
"TERMINAL VELOCITY" with the "4" signature made explicit but subtle. The second "I" in VELOCITY is replaced or overlaid with a "4" — barely noticeable at first glance, but present. The hidden signature revealed in the typography itself.

### Prompt
```
Typographic banner, clean and minimal. "TERMINAL VELOCITY" in refined 
monospace or technical sans-serif, soft white (#f5f5f4) on deep slate 
(#2e3c44) background. The typography is sharp, professional, restrained. 
The hidden detail: the second "I" in "VELOCITY" is subtly rendered as a 
"4" — same weight, same height, integrated so smoothly it reads as "I" at 
first glance but reveals itself on closer inspection. The "4" is in gold 
(#ffd144), a slightly different tone than the white letters, drawing the 
eye only if you look. Subtle motion element: faint vertical lines behind 
the text suggesting descent, in barely-visible burnt orange (#ff9e54). 
Below the main text, small and understated in teal (#44cca4): "Forensic 
Research Framework" or the signature line. The overall effect is 
professional, minimal, with a hidden layer of meaning. The "4" signature 
embedded in the word itself. Wide banner format, ample negative space.
```

### Subtle Elements
- The "4" hidden in plain sight
- Faint vertical descent lines
- Generous negative space
- Gold on white = subtle but present

### Aspect Ratio
4:1 or 3:1 (wide banner)

## GENERAL STYLE NOTES

### Typography Choices
- **Primary:** Bold condensed sans-serif, monospace, or technical/industrial faces
- **Avoid:** Scripts, serifs, decorative fonts, playful weights
- **Character:** Mechanical, precise, urgent, institutional

### What the Type Should Feel Like
- Cockpit instruments
- Mission control readouts
- Industrial gauges
- Transit signage
- Warning labels
- Flight data recorders

### Motion in Typography
- Motion blur (horizontal or vertical)
- Staggered baselines (letters at different heights = falling)
- Trails/streaks behind letterforms
- Rotation suggesting tumble
- Scale variation (larger = closer/lower in fall)
- Fragmentation (letters breaking apart at speed)

### Subtle Background Elements (Use Sparingly)
- Grid lines (ground approach)
- Altitude/data readouts (edge of frame, barely visible)
- Horizon line (ground reference)
- Speed lines (parallel streaks)
- Particle scatter (dust, data fragments)
- Atmospheric gradient (dark to lighter at bottom = ground glow)

## WHAT TO AVOID

❌ Typography that sits still  
❌ Decorative flourishes  
❌ Centered, static, balanced compositions  
❌ Illustrations that compete with type  
❌ Busy backgrounds that overwhelm  
❌ Hopeful, uplifting color tones  
❌ Playful or whimsical type treatments  
❌ The word just sitting there doing nothing  

---

## WHAT WE WANT

✅ Type that implies motion  
✅ Letterforms as falling objects  
✅ Subtle environmental context  
✅ The "4" palette integrated naturally  
✅ Minimal but meaningful backgrounds  
✅ Industrial/technical typography feel  
✅ Tension between readable and kinetic  
✅ The word embodying its meaning
