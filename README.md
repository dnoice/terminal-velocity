# TERMINAL VELOCITY

## A Forensic Investigation into Civilizational Self-Destruction

> *"Terminal velocity is the maximum speed attainable by an object as it falls

## Overview

This repository contains the complete research framework for documenting mechanisms
by which industrial civilization accelerates toward hard planetary boundaries.

## Quick Start

1. Navigate to a mechanism dossier in `mechanism_dossiers/`
2. Read the `DOSSIER.md` for the executive summary
3. Explore `evidence_archive/` for underlying data
4. Run notebooks in `evidence_archive/computations/` to reproduce findings
