## Mechanism Proposal

### Proposed Classification

- **Code:** [e.g., A-11, B-11, etc.]
- **Name:** [Mechanism name]
- **Vector:** [A: Atmospheric | B: Biosphere | C: Hydrological | D: Chemical | E: Depletion | F: Systemic]
- **Status:** [Active | Accelerating | Critical | Growing]
- **Estimated Confidence:** [★☆☆☆☆ to ★★★★★]

---

### Damage Summary

**What is being destroyed?**
<!-- Be specific. Not "the environment" but "X hectares of Y habitat" or "Z species populations" -->


**Who/what bears the cost?**
<!-- Human populations, ecosystems, species, future generations -->


**Geographic scope:**
<!-- Where does this happen? Global, regional, specific locations? -->


---

### Causal Chain (Preliminary)

```
[DRIVER] → [ACTIVITY] → [EMISSION/EXTRACTION] → [PATHWAY] → [EXPOSURE] → [DAMAGE]
```

<!-- Fill in the chain for your proposed mechanism -->

---

### Preliminary Evidence

**Grade I-II Sources (Required minimum):**
<!-- At least one peer-reviewed measurement or official inventory source -->

1. [Source with DOI/URL]
2. [Source with DOI/URL]

**Supporting Sources (Grade III-V):**
<!-- Models, expert assessments, reports -->

1. [Source]
2. [Source]

---

### Differentiation

**How is this distinct from existing mechanisms?**
<!-- Explain why this isn't covered by current inventory -->


**Related mechanisms:**
<!-- List codes of mechanisms this connects to -->
- Upstream: 
- Downstream: 
- Parallel: 

---

### Feasibility Assessment

- [ ] Grade I-II evidence exists for damage quantification
- [ ] Causal pathway can be documented with available data
- [ ] Does not substantially duplicate existing dossiers
- [ ] Named actors can be identified from public record
- [ ] I am willing to contribute to the full dossier (or identify who will)
