## Evidence Grading System

| Grade | Name | Definition |
|-------|------|------------|
| **I** | Direct Measurement | Empirical observations from peer-reviewed monitoring |
| **II** | Official Inventory | Government/multilateral agency accounting |
| **III** | Validated Model | Peer-reviewed models with documented assumptions |
| **IV** | Expert Assessment | Consensus statements, systematic reviews |
| **V** | Qualified Report | Industry reporting, investigative journalism |
| **VI** | Contextual | Commentary (background only, never as proof) |

## Usage Rules

1. **Damage claims require Grade I-II evidence.** No exceptions.
2. **Causal pathway claims require Grade I-III evidence** with explicit uncertainty.
3. **Driver identification requires Grade II-V evidence** with corroboration.
4. **Intervention assessments may use Grade IV-V evidence** with clear flagging.
5. **Grade VI material** provides context only and must be labeled.

## Reproducibility Requirements

- All notebooks must run end-to-end from pinned environment
- Raw data never hand-edited; all transformations via code
- Figures/tables generated by documented scripts
- Uncertainty ranges explicit on all quantitative claims

## Voice & Tone

- Clinical precision with controlled fury
- Specificity over abstraction
- Show the math, skip the sermon
- Name names where public record supports it
- Acknowledge uncertainty like adults
