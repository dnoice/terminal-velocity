## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

[3-5 sentences. What this mechanism does. Scale of damage. Key beneficiaries. 
Why it persists. What would stop it.]

---

## THE DAMAGE

### What's Being Destroyed

[Specific, quantified impacts. Not "biodiversity loss" but "X species extinct, 
Y populations declined Z% since [year], habitat reduced by W hectares."]

### Who Bears the Cost

[Human populations affected, with demographics. Ecosystems, species. Future 
generations. Quantify where possible.]

### Geographic Footprint

[Where this happens. Maps. Hotspots. Jurisdictional complexity.]

### Temporal Pattern

[When did this start? Acceleration curve? Projections?]

---

## THE PATHWAY

### Causal Chain

[Step-by-step: Input → Process → Output → Impact. Be specific.]

```
[DRIVER] → [ACTIVITY] → [EMISSION/EXTRACTION] → [PATHWAY] → [EXPOSURE] → [DAMAGE]
```

### Feedback Loops

[Self-reinforcing dynamics. What makes this worse over time?]

### Enabling Conditions

[What allows this to continue? Legal frameworks, subsidies, information gaps, 
collective action problems.]

---

## THE DRIVERS

### Who Benefits

[Name specific companies, industries, investor classes. Quantify profits where 
possible. Trace money flows.]

### Who Decides

[Executives, board members, agency heads, elected officials. Name names where 
public record supports it.]

### Political Economy

[Lobbying expenditures. Campaign contributions. Revolving doors. Trade 
associations. Think tank funding.]

## THE INTERVENTION QUESTION

### Leverage Points

[Where could intervention actually work?]

### Resistance Factors

[Why hasn't it been stopped? What interests oppose change?]

### Precedents

[What's been tried? What happened?]

### What Would Actually Work

[Be specific. Policy mechanisms, economic instruments, enforcement requirements.]

### Difficulty Score: [X/10]

[Justify the rating]
