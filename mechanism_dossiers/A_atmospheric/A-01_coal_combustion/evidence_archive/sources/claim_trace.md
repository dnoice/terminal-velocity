# Claim Traceability: A-01 - Coal Combustion Chain

## Evidence Grading System

Based on clinical medicine hierarchy, adapted for sustainability research:

| Grade | Description | Criteria |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| I | Systematic reviews, meta-analyses | Multiple high-quality studies synthesized |
| II | Peer-reviewed original research | Single robust study, transparent methodology |
| III | Official statistics (government, IGO) | Authoritative institutional data |
| IV | Industry/NGO reports | Reputable organizations with methodology |
| V | Expert consensus, professional judgment | Acknowledged experts, reasoned analysis |
| VI | Anecdotal, journalistic, unverified | Useful but unconfirmed |
