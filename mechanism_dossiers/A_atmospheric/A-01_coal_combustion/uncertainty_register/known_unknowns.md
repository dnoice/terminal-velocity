# Known Unknowns: A-01 - Coal Combustion Chain

## Executive Summary

While the fundamental science of coal combustion impacts is well-established, significant knowledge gaps remain in attribution precision, health exposure modeling, economic valuation, and transition dynamics. These gaps create uncertainty but do not undermine the core conclusions about harm causation or the urgency of phase-out.

## 3. Impact of Unknowns on Conclusions

### 3.1 Robust Conclusions (Unknowns Do Not Undermine)

| Conclusion | Why Robust |
|------------|-----------|
| Coal combustion causes climate change | Basic physics, overwhelming evidence |
| Coal emissions harm human health | Epidemiology, toxicology, RCT-equivalent |
| External costs exceed private benefits | All valuation methods agree on sign |
| Alternatives are now cost-competitive | Market data, auction results |
| Transition is technically feasible | Demonstrated in multiple jurisdictions |

### 3.2 Conclusions Sensitive to Unknowns

| Conclusion | Key Uncertainty | Range of Outcomes |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Optimal carbon price | Social cost of carbon | $50-400/tonne |
| Phase-out timeline | Damage urgency vs. transition feasibility | 2030-2050 |
| Regional prioritization | Local health/climate impacts | Context-dependent |
| Compensation levels | Transition costs | Wide range |

### 3.3 How Unknowns Could Change Analysis

| If We Learn... | Implication for Analysis |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| Climate sensitivity is high (4.5°C) | Faster phase-out required |
| No safe PM2.5 threshold exists | All coal is harmful |
| Grid integration easier than expected | Faster transition feasible |
| Tipping points closer than estimated | Emergency response needed |
| Transition costs lower than expected | Weaker opposition rationale |

## 4. Handling Unknowns

### 4.1 Precautionary Approach

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Irreversibility warrants caution | Climate damage is permanent |
| Worst-case avoidance | Plan for high-sensitivity scenario |
| Option value preservation | Don't foreclose future choices |
| Burden of proof on polluter | Require evidence of safety |

### 4.2 Scenario Analysis

| Scenario | Unknowns Addressed | Use |
|----------|-------------------|-----|
| Low/central/high damage | Climate sensitivity, damage function | Risk assessment |
| Optimistic/pessimistic transition | Technology costs, policy | Planning |
| Just/unjust transition | Worker/community outcomes | Equity analysis |

### 4.3 Adaptive Management

| Strategy | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| Monitor key indicators | Track tipping point proximity |
| Update as evidence emerges | Revise timeline based on learning |
| Build in flexibility | Design policies that can accelerate |
| Maintain research investment | Close priority unknowns |

## 5. Unknown Unknowns

### 5.1 Potential Surprises (Low Probability, High Impact)

| Possible Surprise | Direction | Implication |
|-------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Rapid tipping point cascade | Worse than expected | Emergency response |
| Breakthrough cheap storage | Better than expected | Faster transition |
| Methane bomb release | Worse than expected | All scenarios worsen |
| Political regime shift | Either direction | Accelerate or delay |
| Health effect discovery | Likely worse | Higher urgency |

### 5.2 What We Don't Know We Don't Know

By definition, cannot enumerate. Approach:
- Maintain epistemic humility
- Expect surprises
- Build resilient strategies
- Preserve optionality
