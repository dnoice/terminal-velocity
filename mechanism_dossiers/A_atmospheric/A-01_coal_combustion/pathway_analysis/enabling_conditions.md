# Enabling Conditions: A-01 - Coal Combustion Chain

## Executive Summary

Coal combustion continues despite overwhelming evidence of harm because multiple enabling conditions remain in place: externalized costs, regulatory gaps, political capture, institutional inertia, and the absence of equivalent alternatives in some regions. Each enabling condition represents an intervention opportunity.

## 1. Economic Enabling Conditions

### 1.1 Externalized Costs

| Externality | True Cost | Current Price | Gap |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|-----|
| CO2 emissions | $50-200/tonne | $0-30/tonne | $20-200/tonne |
| Health impacts (PM2.5) | $100-400/MWh | $0 | $100-400/MWh |
| Mercury contamination | $5-50/MWh | $0-5 | $0-45/MWh |
| Water use/contamination | $2-20/MWh | $0-2 | $0-18/MWh |
| **Total externality** | **$157-670/MWh** | **$0-37** | **$120-633/MWh** |

**Implication**: If externalities were priced, coal would be 3-10x more expensive than current market price

### 1.2 Subsidy Structure

| Subsidy Type | Global Value (2023) | Primary Beneficiaries |
|--------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Direct production subsidies | $30 billion | Mining companies |
| Consumer price subsidies | $500 billion | Consumers, utilities |
| Tax expenditures | $50 billion | Coal companies |
| Implicit subsidies (unpaid externalities) | $6.4 trillion | All users |
| **Total** | **$7+ trillion** | |

**IMF 2023 Estimate**: Fossil fuel subsidies = 7.1% of global GDP

### 1.3 Capital Lock-In

| Investment Type | Committed Capital | Remaining Economic Life |
|-----------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Operating coal plants | $1.2 trillion | 15-30 years average |
| Mines under development | $100 billion | 20-40 years |
| Transport infrastructure | $300 billion | 30-50+ years |
| Utility rate base | $800 billion | Depreciation schedules |

**Stranded Asset Risk**: $1-3 trillion if 1.5°C pathway followed

## 2. Regulatory Enabling Conditions

### 2.1 Regulatory Gaps

| Gap Type | Description | Enabling Effect |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| No global carbon price | Fragmented, insufficient pricing | Free pollution in most markets |
| Weak enforcement | Permit violations unpunished | Emissions exceed permits |
| Grandfather clauses | Old plants exempt from new standards | Dirtiest plants continue |
| Cross-border pollution | No accountability mechanism | Transboundary harm ignored |
| Intergenerational harm | No legal standing for future victims | Climate damage uncompensated |

### 2.2 Jurisdictional Arbitrage

| Jurisdiction | Environmental Standards | Coal Trend |
|--------------|------------------------|------------|
| EU | Stringent (ETS, IED) | Declining |
| US | Moderate (CAA, state variation) | Declining |
| China | Improving but uneven | Plateauing |
| India | Weak enforcement | Growing |
| Indonesia | Minimal | Growing |
| Vietnam | Weak | Growing |

**Pattern**: Production and consumption shift to weaker regulatory environments

### 2.3 Regulatory Capture

| Mechanism | Example | Effect |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Revolving door | Industry executives in EPA | Weakened standards |
| Comment period manipulation | Industry floods dockets | Rules delayed/weakened |
| Litigation | Industry sues EPA | Rules struck down |
| State preemption | Federal limits on state action | Innovation blocked |

---

## 3. Political Enabling Conditions

### 3.1 Political Economy Structure

| Factor | Description | Effect |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Geographic concentration | Coal jobs in swing states/regions | Electoral leverage |
| Campaign finance | Industry donations | Political debt |
| Lobbying access | Well-funded presence | Policy influence |
| Revolving door | Industry-government movement | Aligned interests |
| Narrative control | "War on coal," "energy security" | Public opinion |

### 3.2 Regional Political Capture

| Region | Political Mechanism | Result |
|--------|---------------------|--------|
| US Appalachia | Coal identity politics | Federal resistance |
| US Wyoming | State economy dependence | Export advocacy |
| Poland | Coal = energy security narrative | EU resistance |
| Australia | Mining lobby power | Climate policy weakness |
| India | Coal India employment | Slow transition |

### 3.3 International Political Dynamics

| Dynamic | Enabling Effect |
|---------|-----------------|
| North-South divide | Developing countries resist restrictions |
| Energy security concerns | Coal as "domestic" fuel preference |
| Just transition demands | Costs of transition delay action |
| Climate finance gaps | Insufficient support for alternatives |

---

## 4. Institutional Enabling Conditions

### 4.1 Utility Business Models

| Model Feature | Enabling Effect |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Rate-base regulation | Profits tied to asset ownership |
| Fuel cost pass-through | No incentive for efficiency |
| Long-term contracts | Inflexible fuel commitments |
| Grid dispatch rules | Coal often given priority |
| Vertical integration | Internal coal preference |

### 4.2 Financial System Inertia

| Institution Type | Enabling Behavior |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Commercial banks | Coal lending continues (>$1T since Paris) |
| Development banks | Some still finance coal |
| Insurance | Some still underwrite coal |
| Credit rating agencies | Slow to price climate risk |
| Pension funds | Slow divestment |

### 4.3 Knowledge System Gaps

| Gap | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| Accounting standards | Externalities not on balance sheet |
| Economics training | Externality theory taught, not applied |
| Engineering education | Coal technology still taught |
| Policy analysis | Cost-benefit ignores distribution, future |

## 5. Technical Enabling Conditions

### 5.1 Grid and Infrastructure

| Factor | Enabling Effect |
|--------|-----------------|
| Coal-centric grid design | Alternatives face interconnection barriers |
| Baseload thinking | Overvalues coal's dispatchability |
| Reserve margin rules | Favor incumbent capacity |
| Transmission constraints | Limit renewable access |

### 5.2 Supply Chain Lock-In

| Component | Lock-In Mechanism |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Mining equipment | Specialized, long-lived |
| Rail rolling stock | Coal-specific wagons |
| Port infrastructure | Coal terminals |
| Workforce skills | Coal-specific training |

### 5.3 Regional Alternative Gaps

| Region | Alternative Gap | Enabling Effect |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Mongolia | Grid isolation | Coal only option |
| South Africa | Transmission limits | Renewable integration slow |
| Poland | Historical dependence | Infrastructure gap |

| Subsidy elimination | 30-50% demand reduction |
| Strict enforcement | 20-30% emissions reduction |
