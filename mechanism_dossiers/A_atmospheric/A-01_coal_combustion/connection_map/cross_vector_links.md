# Cross-Vector Links: A-01 - Coal Combustion Chain

## Executive Summary

Coal combustion connects to mechanisms across all six Terminal Velocity damage vectors: Atmospheric (A), Hydrological (B), Terrestrial (C), Marine (D), Chemical (E), and Socioeconomic (F). These cross-vector links demonstrate the systemic nature of coal's harm and reveal opportunities for integrated intervention strategies that address multiple damage pathways simultaneously.
