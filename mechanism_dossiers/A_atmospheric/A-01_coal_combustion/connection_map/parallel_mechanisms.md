# Parallel Mechanisms: A-01 - Coal Combustion Chain

## Executive Summary

Coal combustion operates alongside parallel mechanisms with similar characteristics: oil & gas combustion (same climate driver), other air pollution sources (same health pathway), and other extractive industries (same political economy). Coordinated intervention across parallel mechanisms can achieve greater impact than isolated action through shared strategies and combined political pressure.

## 2. Energy Sector Parallels

### 2.1 Oil & Gas Combustion (A-02)

|--------|------|-----------|------------|
| Primary harm | CO2, PM2.5 | CO2, methane | Same climate pathway |
| Annual CO2 | 15.5 Gt | ~20 Gt (combined) | Same order of magnitude |
| Industry structure | Concentrated | Concentrated | Similar political economy |
| Intervention | Phase-out | Phase-out | Same policy toolkit |
| Timeline | 2040 phase-out | 2050 phase-out | Coordinated transition |

**Coordination Opportunities:**

- Combined carbon pricing
- Unified "fossil fuel" framing
- Shared divestment campaigns
- Coordinated just transition

### 2.2 Natural Gas Combustion

| Aspect | Coal | Natural Gas | Relationship |
|--------|------|-------------|--------------|

| Air quality | Very high impact | Lower local impact | Gas is "cleaner" locally |
| Lock-in risk | Existing fleet | New infrastructure | Gas delays transition |

**Strategic Tension:**

- Gas has enabled coal phase-out in some regions
- But gas creates new lock-in
- Methane leakage may offset benefits
- Optimal strategy: Coal first, then gas
