# Upstream Mechanisms: A-01 - Coal Combustion Chain

## Executive Summary

Coal combustion depends on multiple upstream mechanisms: coal mining and extraction, transportation infrastructure, financial flows, and enabling policy/regulatory frameworks. Interventions at upstream points can prevent combustion from occurring, often more effectively than downstream mitigation. This map identifies key upstream dependencies and intervention opportunities.
