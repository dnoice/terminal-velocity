# Downstream Mechanisms: A-01 - Coal Combustion Chain

## Executive Summary

Coal combustion feeds into multiple downstream mechanisms across all damage vectors: climate system disruption (A-vector), water system impacts (B-vector), terrestrial ecosystem damage (C-vector), marine impacts (D-vector), and chemical contamination (E-vector). The downstream cascade multiplies initial harm through feedback loops and compound effects.
