# Beneficiary Map: A-01 - Coal Combustion Chain

## Executive Summary

The coal combustion chain generates approximately $800 billion in annual revenues, concentrated among a small number of mining companies, utilities, and financial intermediaries. However, when externalized costs ($7+ trillion) are included, the industry operates at a massive net loss to society. Benefits accrue to shareholders, executives, and certain labor constituencies while costs are dispersed across global populations.
