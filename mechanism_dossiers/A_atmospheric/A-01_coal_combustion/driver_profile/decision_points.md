# Decision Points: A-01 - Coal Combustion Chain

## Executive Summary

The coal combustion chain involves thousands of discrete decisions across investment, operations, policy, and consumption domains. Key decision points with highest leverage include: new project investment decisions, plant retirement timing, grid dispatch rules, and policy/regulatory choices. Understanding who decides, using what criteria, enables targeted intervention.
