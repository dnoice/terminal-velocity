# Political Economy: A-01 - Coal Combustion Chain

## Executive Summary

The coal industry maintains political influence through concentrated lobbying, campaign contributions, regional employment leverage, and narrative control. This political economy has historically blocked or delayed climate action, but is weakening as economic fundamentals shift, demographics change, and counter-mobilization grows. Understanding these dynamics enables strategic intervention.
