# MECHANISM DOSSIER: A-01

## Coal Combustion Chain

**Vector:** Atmospheric Loading
**Status:** 🟡 Active
**Confidence:** ★★★★★
**Last Updated:** 2025-12-14
**Lead Investigator:** Dennis 'dnoice' Smaltz

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The coal combustion chain converts geological carbon into atmospheric CO2 at a scale of **15.5 Gt annually** (40% of global energy-related emissions), representing the single largest contributor to anthropogenic climate change and directly responsible for **over 0.3C** of the current 1.2C global temperature increase. The mechanism kills an estimated **460,000+ people** from particulate emissions in the United States alone, with coal-derived PM2.5 carrying **double the mortality risk** of particulates from other sources. Despite this, global coal consumption reached an **all-time high of 8.8 billion tonnes in 2024**, with China and India accounting for 87% of new capacity development. The mechanism persists because of $7 trillion in annual fossil fuel subsidies, $385 billion in bank financing (2022-2024), and the entrenched political economy of state-owned coal enterprises. Stopping it requires eliminating subsidies, enforcing true-cost pricing, and accelerating the closure timeline that has already succeeded in the UK (coal-free as of September 2024) and is advancing in the EU.

## THE DAMAGE

### What's Being Destroyed

**Atmospheric Composition:**

- Global energy-related CO2 emissions: **37.8 Gt in 2024** (all-time high, +0.8% from 2023)
- Coal's contribution: **15.5 Gt CO2** (40% of energy-related emissions)
- Atmospheric CO2 concentration: **422.5 ppm in 2024** (50% above pre-industrial levels of ~280 ppm)
- Coal emissions grew **0.9% (135 Mt CO2)** in 2024

**Climate Destabilization:**

- Coal is responsible for **over 0.3C** of the 1.2C global temperature rise since pre-industrial times
- This makes coal the **single largest source of global temperature increase**
- Remaining carbon budget for 1.5C: approximately **8 years** at current emission rates

**Human Health:**

- **460,000 deaths** attributable to coal PM2.5 in the United States (1999-2020)
- Coal PM2.5 causes **1.12% mortality increase per 1 ug/m3**—more than double the risk from general PM2.5
- Globally, PM2.5 contributes to **7 million deaths annually**, with coal a major contributor
- Air pollution (including coal) costs the average person **2.3 years of life expectancy**
- 99% of the global population breathes air exceeding WHO guidelines (5 ug/m3 PM2.5)

**Toxic Contamination:**

- Coal combustion is the **2nd largest source of anthropogenic mercury emissions** (21% of global total)
- Annual mercury emissions from coal: approximately **2,220 tonnes**
- Coal PM2.5 is rich in sulfur dioxide, black carbon, and heavy metals
- Mercury is one of WHO's **top 10 chemicals of major public health concern**

### Who Bears the Cost

**Geographic Distribution of Health Burden:**

- **China and India** together account for **58% of global PM2.5 mortality burden**
- China accounts for **one-third of global mercury emissions** (600-800 tonnes/year)
- Low-income communities near coal plants suffer disproportionate exposure
- In the US, 10 individual coal plants each contributed at least **5,000 deaths** during the study period

**Economic Burden:**

- Air pollution (including coal) reduces global GDP through healthcare costs, lost productivity
- Climate damages from coal emissions compound annually through feedback loops
- Future generations inherit a degraded atmosphere with diminished carbon budget

**Most Affected Demographics:**

- Elderly populations (Medicare study population)
- Children (air pollution is 2nd leading risk factor for deaths under age 5)
- Communities within 2km of coal plants show elevated blood cancer clusters
- Workers in coal mining and power generation

### Geographic Footprint

**Global Consumption Distribution (2024):**

| Region | Share of Global Consumption | Trend |
|--------|---------------------------|-------|

- **2021:** COP26 Glasgow—197 countries agree to "phase down" coal
- **2024:** Global coal consumption reaches all-time high of 8.8 billion tonnes

**Acceleration Curve:**

- Coal demand grew **1.2%** in 2024 (energy terms)
- Coal demand grew **1.5%** in 2024 (physical tonnes)
- Coal's share of electricity mix: **35%** (lowest since IEA founding in 1974)
- Pre-construction capacity has fallen **68%** since Paris Agreement (2015)

**Projections:**

## THE PATHWAY

### Causal Chain

```
[ECONOMIC DEMAND] -> [COAL EXTRACTION] -> [TRANSPORTATION] -> [COMBUSTION] -> [EMISSIONS] -> [ATMOSPHERIC LOADING] -> [DAMAGE]
     |                    |                    |                |              |                  |               |
 Electricity         Mining ops           Rail/ship        Power plants      CO2, PM2.5       Greenhouse      Climate,
 demand, steel      (surface/deep)        networks         (pulverized       SO2, NOx,        effect,         health,
 production,                                               coal, CFB)        mercury,         dispersion      ecosystems
 industrial                                                                  heavy metals
```

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Extraction:** Coal mined from surface or underground operations (8.8 Bt in 2024)
2. **Processing:** Coal washed, sorted, and prepared for transport
3. **Transportation:** Moved via rail, ship, and truck to power plants and industrial facilities
4. **Combustion:** Coal burned at 1,300-1,700C in boilers
5. **Chemical Reaction:** C + O2 -> CO2 (plus release of sulfur, nitrogen, mercury, particulates)
6. **Emission:** Gases and particulates released through stacks (some captured by scrubbers)
7. **Atmospheric Transport:** Emissions disperse regionally and globally
8. **Deposition:** PM2.5 settles in human lungs; CO2 accumulates in atmosphere
9. **Forcing:** CO2 traps infrared radiation, increasing global temperatures
10. **Impact:** Climate destabilization, respiratory disease, cardiovascular death, ecosystem disruption

### Feedback Loops

**Self-Reinforcing Dynamics:**

1. **Infrastructure Lock-in:**
   - Coal plants have 40-50 year operational lifetimes
   - $94.5 GW of new construction started in China in 2024 alone
   - Sunk costs create political pressure to extend operations

2. **Political-Economic Spiral:**
   - Coal revenues fund lobbying for continued subsidies
   - Subsidies keep coal artificially competitive
   - Continued operation generates more lobbying revenue

3. **Electricity Demand Growth:**
   - Economic development increases electricity demand
   - Coal remains cheapest dispatchable baseload in many markets
   - AI/data center growth adding new demand (mechanism A-10)

4. **Supply Chain Dependencies:**
   - Coal-dependent industries resist transition
   - Steel, cement production embedded in coal value chain
   - Creates multi-sector resistance to phase-out

**Negative Feedbacks (Countervailing Forces):**

- Renewable costs declining rapidly (solar now cheapest in most markets)
- Air pollution visibility creates public pressure
- Climate damages accelerating policy response
- ESG/divestment pressures on financial flows

### Enabling Conditions

**What Allows This to Continue:**

1. **Massive Subsidies:**
   - **$7 trillion** in global fossil fuel subsidies (2022), 7.1% of global GDP
   - 80% of global coal priced below half its true cost
   - Subsidies exceed government spending on education (4.3% GDP)

2. **Externalized Costs:**
   - Health costs borne by individuals and public health systems
   - Climate costs deferred to future generations
   - No carbon price in most jurisdictions

3. **State Ownership:**
   - Coal India Limited is state-owned (world's largest producer)
   - China's coal sector dominated by state-owned enterprises
   - 60% of India's 2024 proposals backed by state-owned entities

4. **Financial System Complicity:**
   - **$385 billion** in bank financing to coal (2022-2024)
   - Corporate-level financing bypasses project-level restrictions
   - Coal financing rebounded to $130B in 2024 after declining to $123B in 2023

5. **Political Economy:**
   - Employment in coal regions creates political constituencies
   - Trade associations coordinate lobbying
   - Revolving door between industry and regulators

## THE UNCERTAINTY

### What We Don't Know

1. **Precise mortality attribution:** While the 460,000 US deaths figure is robust, global coal mortality estimates vary widely (potentially millions)

2. **Full subsidy accounting:** $7T IMF estimate includes modeled externalities; explicit subsidies are ~$1.3T—both methodologies valid but serve different purposes

3. **China's actual timeline:** Official peak coal pledges vs. actual construction permits diverge

4. **Just transition employment numbers:** Global coal employment figures are inconsistent across sources

5. **Indirect emissions:** Full lifecycle emissions including mining, transport, ash disposal not always included in inventories

### Measurement Limitations

**Data Quality Issues:**

- Self-reported emissions data from some jurisdictions
- Mercury measurements have geographic gaps
- Health attribution models rely on exposure estimates

**Coverage Gaps:**

- Small-scale coal operations often unreported
- Informal sector coal use in developing countries
- Historical emissions reconstructed from models

**Definitional Problems:**

- "Coal capacity" can mean nameplate, operational, or utilized
- "Subsidies" varies by methodology (explicit vs. implicit)
- PM2.5 source attribution models have uncertainties

### Sensitivity Analysis

**What Would Change Conclusions:**

| Assumption | If Wrong, Impact |
|------------|-----------------|
| Coal PM2.5 mortality multiplier (2x) | Could reduce estimated deaths by ~50% |
| IMF externality valuations | Explicit subsidies alone still $1.3T |
| China construction data accuracy | Could affect pipeline projections |
| Atmospheric residence time | Minor effect on cumulative forcing |

**Robust Findings (Low Sensitivity):**

- Coal is largest single CO2 source: Multiple independent measurements
- Health impacts are severe: Consistent across study methodologies
- Subsidies are massive: Even explicit-only is enormous
- Pipeline concentrated in China/India: Direct observation

### Alternative Interpretations

**Steel-Man Arguments for Coal:**

1. **Energy security:** Coal provides dispatchable baseload power; renewables are intermittent
   - *Counter:* Battery storage costs falling rapidly; grid management solutions exist

2. **Development necessity:** Emerging economies need cheap energy for growth
   - *Counter:* Renewables now cheaper than coal in most markets; development can leapfrog

3. **Employment:** Millions depend on coal jobs
   - *Counter:* Just transition programs can support workers; clean energy creates more jobs per dollar

4. **Reliability:** Coal plants run 24/7 regardless of weather
   - *Counter:* Diversified grids with storage can achieve similar reliability

5. **Existing infrastructure:** Shutting down plants wastes capital investment
   - *Counter:* Continued operation has higher social cost than stranded asset losses

## THE INTERVENTION QUESTION

### Leverage Points

**High-Impact Intervention Points:**

1. **Subsidy Elimination:**
   - Removing $7T in subsidies would immediately change coal's competitive position
   - Full reform would reduce global CO2 emissions 43% by 2030 (IMF estimate)
   - Would raise revenues worth 3.6% of global GDP

2. **Carbon Pricing:**
   - True-cost pricing makes renewables definitively cheaper
   - EU ETS demonstrating effectiveness (coal down 15% in 2024)
   - Requires international coordination to prevent leakage

3. **Financial Sector Pressure:**
   - Divestment reduces capital access, increases cost of capital
   - Harvard study: Divested coal firms reduce borrowing by 25%, close facilities
   - Over 200 financial institutions have divestment policies

4. **Construction Moratorium:**
   - Stopping new builds avoids 40-50 years of lock-in
   - China and India are the critical jurisdictions
   - International pressure and financing conditions as levers

5. **Retirement Acceleration:**
   - UK model: Complete phase-out achievable in major economies
   - Germany committed to 2038 (ideally 2030)
   - JETP (Just Energy Transition Partnerships) model for emerging economies

### Resistance Factors

**Why It Hasn't Stopped:**

1. **Scale of Incumbent Interests:**
   - $110B+ market cap companies
   - Millions of workers
   - State ownership entangles government interests

2. **Subsidy Entrenchment:**
   - 80 years of infrastructure investment
   - Political constituencies in coal regions
   - Energy security narratives

3. **Financial System Inertia:**
   - $130B in new financing in 2024 despite pledges
   - Corporate-level lending bypasses project restrictions
   - Short-term profit incentives

4. **International Coordination Failure:**
   - No binding global coal phase-out agreement
   - Glasgow "phase down" language weaker than "phase out"
   - China and India not bound by developed-country timelines

5. **Narrative Control:**
   - "Clean coal" framing delays action
   - Jobs vs. environment false dichotomy
   - Energy security concerns exploited

### Precedents

**What's Been Tried:**

| Intervention | Location | Result |
|--------------|----------|--------|
| Complete phase-out | UK (2024) | **Success:** Coal-free after 142 years |
| Accelerated retirement | EU | **Progressing:** Down 15% in 2024 |
| Divestment campaigns | Global | **Partial:** 200+ institutions committed |
| Carbon pricing (ETS) | EU | **Effective:** Driving closures |
| MATS regulations | US | **Mixed:** Coal deaths down 95% 1999-2020 |
| JETP financing | Indonesia, Vietnam, South Africa | **Early stage:** Implementation ongoing |
| Coal moratorium | Philippines | **Effective:** New permits blocked |

**Key Success Factors:**

- Clear timelines with enforcement
- Alternative capacity in place
- Just transition support for workers
- Financial incentives aligned

### What Would Actually Work

**Required Policy Package:**

1. **Immediate (0-2 years):**
   - Global moratorium on new coal plant financing
   - Mandatory disclosure of coal exposure by financial institutions
   - Accelerated retirement schedules for existing plants in advanced economies

2. **Medium-term (2-5 years):**
   - International coal phase-out treaty with binding commitments
   - Carbon border adjustments to prevent leakage
   - Massive just transition funding ($100B+ annually)

3. **Long-term (5-15 years):**
   - Complete phase-out in developed economies by 2030
   - Complete phase-out in emerging economies by 2040
   - Atmospheric CO2 stabilization through complementary CDR

**Specific Mechanisms:**

- Extend EU ETS model globally
- Condition IMF/World Bank financing on phase-out plans
- Mandatory corporate climate disclosure (SEC rules)
- Just transition bonds and funds
- Retraining and early retirement programs

### Difficulty Score: 7/10

**Justification:**

This mechanism rates 7/10 (Very Difficult) because:

**Factors Increasing Difficulty:**

- Massive scale: 8.8 billion tonnes annually, $800B+ industry
- State ownership: Government interests entangled with industry
- China/India growth: 87% of new development in two countries
- Employment: Millions of workers in coal-dependent regions
- Infrastructure lock-in: 40-50 year plant lifetimes

**Factors Decreasing Difficulty:**

- Alternatives exist: Renewables now cheaper in most markets
- Precedents proven: UK, EU demonstrating phase-out feasibility
- Financial pressure working: Divestment campaigns showing impact
- Health costs visible: Public pressure from air pollution
- Technology available: No fundamental technical barriers

**Not a 9-10 because:** Unlike some mechanisms requiring fundamental economic transformation, coal phase-out is technically and economically feasible with existing alternatives. The barriers are political and transitional, not technological.
