# Leverage Points: A-01 - Coal Combustion Chain

## Executive Summary

Using Donella Meadows' hierarchy of leverage points, this analysis identifies where interventions in the coal combustion system can be most effective. The highest leverage points involve changing the paradigm (coal = progress) and system goals (growth → wellbeing), while lower but more immediately actionable points include financial flows, information flows, and physical infrastructure.

### 1.2 Coal System Mapping

```text
HIGH LEVERAGE (Hard to implement, transformative)
│
├─ Paradigm Change
│  └─ "Coal = Progress" → "Clean energy = Progress"
│
├─ System Goals
│  └─ GDP growth → Human wellbeing
│
├─ Rules Change
│  └─ Externality pricing, phase-out mandates
│
├─ Information Flows
│  └─ Emissions disclosure, health data access
│
└─ Financial Flows
   └─ Subsidies → Clean energy, carbon pricing

LOW LEVERAGE (Easy to implement, incremental)
```

## 2. High Leverage Points

### 2.1 Paradigm Shift (Rank 2)

**Current Paradigm:** Coal represents progress, industrial strength, energy security

**Target Paradigm:** Coal represents legacy technology, health threat, stranded asset risk

| Health feedback | Delayed (chronic effects) | Acute awareness | Moderate |
| Political feedback | Weak (lobby capture) | Campaign finance reform | Moderate |
| Investment feedback | Emerging | ESG mandates | Strong |

**Weaken Positive Feedback (Reinforcing Loops):**

| Feedback | Current Strength | Intervention | Target |
|----------|------------------|--------------|--------|
| Scale economies | Strong | Level playing field | Moderate |
| Political lock-in | Strong | Democratic reform | Weak |
| Infrastructure lock-in | Strong | Early retirement | Weak |
| Knowledge lock-in | Moderate | Retraining programs | Weak |

### 3.3 Delays (Rank 9)

**Problematic Delays:**

| Delay | Duration | Intervention |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Policy → Implementation | 5-10 years | Accelerated permitting |
| Price signal → Investment | 3-5 years | Long-term contracts |
| Health exposure → Disease | 10-30 years | Precautionary principle |
