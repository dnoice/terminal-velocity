# Precedents: A-01 - Coal Combustion Chain

## Executive Summary

Numerous interventions have been attempted to reduce coal combustion harms, ranging from end-of-pipe controls to complete phase-outs. The UK's coal exit demonstrates that rapid phase-out is possible; Germany's shows transition can protect workers; China's shows air quality can motivate action. Key lessons: economics drives change, phase-out dates create certainty, and political will is the binding constraint.

## 1. Successful Interventions

### 1.1 Complete Phase-Outs

#### United Kingdom

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Timeline | 1990: 65% of electricity → 2024: <1% |
| Mechanism | Carbon price floor, gas competition, air quality |
| Last plant closure | September 2024 (Ratcliffe-on-Soar) |
| Jobs impact | ~6,000 coal jobs lost, managed decline |
| Key factors | Political consensus, gas availability, EU ETS |

**Lessons:**
- Carbon pricing works when sufficiently high (UK floor £18+/tonne)
- Gas as bridge fuel enabled rapid coal exit
- Cross-party consensus prevented policy reversal
- Long planning horizons allowed managed transition

#### Ontario, Canada

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Timeline | 2003: 25% of electricity → 2014: 0% |
| Mechanism | Political commitment, renewable deployment |
| Health benefit | $3B annually in avoided health costs |
| Air quality | Smog days reduced from 53 (2005) to 0 (2014) |
| Key factors | Provincial jurisdiction, public health framing |

**Lessons:**
- Public health framing built political support
- Provincial/state level action can bypass federal gridlock
- Measurable air quality improvements create political success

### 1.2 Partial Phase-Outs

#### Germany (Kohleausstieg)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Timeline | 2020 law → 2038 (ideally 2030) phase-out |
| Mechanism | Coal Commission, compensation, structural funds |
| Investment | €40 billion for coal regions |
| Jobs plan | Retraining, early retirement, regional development |
| Key factors | Tripartite negotiation, union involvement |

**Lessons:**
- Stakeholder process builds legitimacy
- Substantial regional investment necessary
- Timeline can accelerate (2038 → 2030 pressure)
- Compensation helps but delays can occur

#### United States (Market-Driven)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Timeline | 2007: 50% of electricity → 2024: ~15% |
| Mechanism | Cheap gas, renewable cost decline, regulations |
| Plant closures | 300+ coal plants retired since 2010 |
| Jobs impact | ~50,000 coal jobs lost (2010-2020) |
| Key factors | Shale gas revolution, state RPS policies |

**Lessons:**
- Market forces can drive change without mandates
- State-level policies effective (RPS, clean energy standards)
- Utility economics increasingly favor retirement
- Just transition support insufficient (Appalachian decline)

### 1.3 Emissions Controls

#### US Clean Air Act

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Timeline | 1970 original, 1990 amendments |
| Mechanism | Technology standards, cap-and-trade (SO2) |
| Results | SO2 reduced 90%+ from peak |
| Acid rain | Largely resolved in North America |
| Key factors | Bipartisan support, trading flexibility |

**Lessons:**
- Cap-and-trade can work at scale
- Flexibility reduces compliance costs
- Phased implementation allows adjustment
- Industry adapted faster than predicted

#### China Air Quality Campaign

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Timeline | 2013 Action Plan → ongoing |
| Mechanism | Plant closures, emissions standards, monitoring |
| Results | PM2.5 down 40%+ in many cities |
| Coal impact | Consumption peaked 2013-2014 |
| Key factors | Public pressure (airpocalypse), central direction |

**Lessons:**
- Air quality can motivate action even without climate framing
- State capacity enables rapid implementation
- Public pressure matters even in authoritarian contexts
- Economic growth can continue during transition

## 2. Failed or Insufficient Interventions

### 2.1 Failed Policies

#### Australian Carbon Price (2012-2014)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Timeline | Introduced July 2012, repealed July 2014 |
| Mechanism | Fixed price ($23/tonne) transitioning to ETS |
| Results | Emissions dropped 1.4% (economy grew 5%) |
| Failure cause | Political reversal (Abbott government) |
| Key factors | Lack of bipartisan support, fossil fuel lobby |

**Lessons:**
- Carbon pricing vulnerable to political reversal
- Industry opposition can overwhelm policy
- Need durable institutional design
- Bipartisan consensus essential for longevity

#### EU ETS Phase 1 (2005-2007)

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Timeline | First compliance period |
| Mechanism | Cap-and-trade for power and industry |
| Results | Prices collapsed to near zero |
| Failure cause | Over-allocation of permits |
| Key factors | Industry lobbying, national allocation plans |

**Lessons:**
- Cap must be binding (scarcity creates price)
- Industry will game allocation if possible
- Need robust monitoring and adjustment mechanisms
- Centralized cap-setting better than national

### 2.2 Insufficient Interventions

#### Voluntary Corporate Commitments

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Mechanism | Net-zero pledges, RE100, etc. |
| Results | Symbolic progress, limited real impact |
| Limitation | Scope 3 excluded, offsetting, delays |
| Key factors | Lack of accountability, greenwashing |

**Lessons:**
- Voluntary alone is insufficient
- Need mandatory disclosure and standards
- Scope 3 inclusion essential
- Third-party verification required

#### Clean Coal Technologies

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Mechanism | CCS, HELE (high efficiency, low emissions) |
| Results | Minimal deployment, cost escalation |
| Investment | $10+ billion in CCS with few successes |
| Key factors | Cost, complexity, continued CO2 problem |

**Lessons:**
- CCS has not delivered at scale
- "Clean coal" largely a delay tactic
- Alternative technologies now cheaper
- Efficiency improvements insufficient

## 3. Historical Analogies

### 3.1 Successful Transitions

#### Tobacco Control

| Aspect | Tobacco | Coal Parallel |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| Timeline | 1960s evidence → 1990s+ action | 1990s evidence → 2020s+ action |
| Mechanism | Litigation, regulation, taxation | Carbon pricing, regulation, liability |
| Industry response | Denial, delay, diversification | Denial, delay, diversification |
| Tipping point | Master Settlement (1998) | Pending |

**Lessons:**
- Scientific evidence alone doesn't change policy
- Litigation can break industry political power
- Public health framing effective
- Took decades but ultimately successful

#### Ozone Depletion (CFCs)

| Aspect | CFCs | Coal Parallel |
|--------|------|---------------|
| Timeline | 1974 evidence → 1987 Montreal Protocol | 1990s evidence → Paris Agreement |
| Mechanism | International treaty, technology substitution | International treaties, technology substitution |
| Industry response | Initial denial, then cooperation | Ongoing denial, some cooperation |
| Key difference | Fewer affected industries, cheaper alternatives | Massive industry, energy security framing |

**Lessons:**
- International cooperation possible
- Technology alternatives enable action
- Industry cooperation accelerates transition
- Smaller problem = easier solution

### 3.2 Relevant Historical Transitions

#### Horse to Automobile (1900-1920)

| Aspect | Transition Lesson |
|--------|-------------------|
| Timeline | ~20 years for dominance |
| Mechanism | Superior technology, cost decline |
| Displaced industry | Horses, stables, blacksmiths |
| Key factor | Consumer preference + infrastructure |

**Lesson:** Technology transitions can be rapid when alternatives are superior

#### Whale Oil to Petroleum (1850-1870)

| Aspect | Transition Lesson |
|--------|-------------------|
| Timeline | ~20 years |
| Mechanism | Petroleum cheaper, more abundant |
| Environmental benefit | Whales not hunted to extinction |
| Key factor | Economic competition |

**Lesson:** Economic superiority drives transition without regulation
