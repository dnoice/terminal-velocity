# Resistance Factors: A-01 - Coal Combustion Chain

## Executive Summary

Coal combustion persists despite clear harms due to a mutually reinforcing system of resistance factors: concentrated economic interests ($980B value chain), political power (lobbying, revolving door, regulatory capture), infrastructure lock-in (2,400 GW assets), institutional inertia, and ideological framing (energy security, development rights). Understanding these factors is essential for designing effective interventions.

## 1. Economic Resistance Factors

### 1.1 Concentrated Benefits vs. Dispersed Costs

| Aspect | Characteristic | Implication |
|--------|----------------|-------------|
| Benefits | Concentrated in few companies, regions, workers | Strong motivation to resist |
| Costs | Dispersed across all populations | Weak motivation to demand change |
| Ratio | Benefits to few, costs to many | Classic collective action problem |
| Result | Organized resistance, disorganized support | Political imbalance |

**Mancur Olson Logic:**
- Coal industry: ~5 million workers globally, $980B revenue, highly organized
- Affected population: ~8 billion people, costs diffuse, poorly organized
- Political outcome: Industry voice dominates despite minority status

### 1.2 Stranded Asset Interests

| Asset Type | Global Value | Owners | Resistance Motivation |
|------------|--------------|--------|----------------------|
| Coal plants | $500-1,000B | Utilities, IPPs | Protect investment recovery |
| Coal mines | $200-400B | Mining companies | Protect revenue stream |
| Rail/port infrastructure | $100-200B | Transport companies | Protect utilization |
| Equipment manufacturers | $50-100B | Industrial companies | Protect orders |

**Resistance Dynamics:**
- Asset owners have strong incentive to delay phase-out
- Each year of delay = additional revenue
- Write-offs hurt stock prices, management bonuses
- Bankruptcy threat motivates political action

### 1.3 Subsidy Dependency

| Subsidy Type | Annual Value | Beneficiaries | Political Power |
|--------------|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Production subsidies | $30B | Coal companies | Strong lobby |
| Consumer price support | $50B | Utilities, consumers | Vote-buying |
| Tax breaks | $20B | Coal companies | Tax lobbyists |
| Implicit (externalities) | $6T+ | All coal users | Diffuse |

**Dependency Loop:**
```text
Subsidies → Artificial profitability → Industry survival → Lobby power → More subsidies
```

## 2. Political Resistance Factors

### 2.1 Lobbying Power

| Country | Annual Coal Lobbying | Key Actors | Effectiveness |
|---------|---------------------|------------|---------------|
| USA | $85-135M/year | API, coal associations | High |
| Australia | $AUD 20-40M/year | Minerals Council | Very High |
| Germany | €30-50M/year | RWE, Uniper | Moderate |
| India | Significant (unreported) | Coal India, associations | High |
| Japan | Significant | JCOAL, utilities | High |

**Lobbying Tactics:**
- Direct campaign contributions
- Revolving door employment
- Industry-funded research
- Grassroots organization (astroturfing)
- Strategic litigation

### 2.2 Regulatory Capture

| Mechanism | Description | Examples |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Personnel | Industry insiders in regulatory positions | EPA administrators, energy ministers |
| Information | Regulators depend on industry data | Emission estimates, cost projections |
| Budget | Industry funds regulatory processes | Permitting fees, legal support |
| Culture | Regulators identify with industry | "Partner" mindset vs. oversight |

**Capture Indicators:**
- Emission standards weaker than health evidence suggests
- Permit approvals despite community opposition
- Enforcement actions rare and weak
- Policies favor incumbents over entrants

### 2.3 Electoral Geography

| Country | Coal Constituencies | Electoral System | Political Leverage |
|---------|---------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| USA | West Virginia, Wyoming, Pennsylvania | Senate overrepresentation | Very High |
| Australia | Queensland, Hunter Valley | Marginal seats | Very High |
| Germany | NRW, Brandenburg, Saxony | Coalition politics | High |
| Poland | Silesia | National identity | Very High |
| India | Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh | State politics | High |

**Geographic Concentration Effect:**
- Coal jobs concentrated in specific regions
- These regions often have outsized electoral influence
- Politicians compete for "coal vote"
- National majority for transition, local majorities against

### 2.4 Political Ideology

| Ideology | Coal Framing | Key Countries |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Free market | Anti-regulation, anti-subsidy (in theory) | USA (Republican) |
| National sovereignty | Energy independence | Poland, India |
| Development rights | Historical emissions, equity | China, India, Global South |
| Anti-elitism | "War on coal," cultural identity | USA (Appalachia), Australia |

## 3. Social Resistance Factors

### 3.1 Employment and Identity

| Factor | Description | Strength |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Direct employment | 5 million jobs globally | Strong |
| Indirect employment | 15+ million jobs in supply chain | Strong |

| Community cohesion | Towns built around coal | Very Strong |
| Skills lock-in | Specialized workforce | Moderate |

**Identity Dimensions:**
- Occupational pride ("We keep the lights on")
- Masculinity norms (dangerous, physical work)
- Family tradition (multi-generation miners)
- Place attachment (mining towns)
- Class consciousness (working class vs. elites)

### 3.2 Fear of Change

| Fear | Basis | Response |
|------|-------|----------|
| Job loss | Real historical precedent | Just transition guarantees |
| Community decline | Observed in past transitions | Regional development |
| Loss of status | Identity threat | Dignified transition |
| Economic uncertainty | Real concerns | Financial security |

### 3.3 Distrust

| Target of Distrust | Basis | Manifestation |
|-------------------|-------|---------------|
| Government | Broken promises (past transitions) | Skepticism of pledges |

| Rail lines | 50-100 years | $100M-1B | Strong |
| Port facilities | 50+ years | $500M-2B | Moderate |
| Grid connections | 30-50 years | Variable | Moderate |

**Lock-In Dynamics:**
```text

| Mining leases | Extraction rights | Strong |
| Supply contracts | Coal delivery commitments | Moderate |
| Labor agreements | Employment guarantees | Moderate |
| International investment treaties | Investor-state dispute | Strong |

**ISDS Risk:**
- Energy Charter Treaty enables investor suits

       └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Infrastructure Lock-In → Stranded Asset Fear → Political Resistance → No Phase-Out → More Lock-In
       ↑                                                                          ↓
