# Requirements: A-01 - Coal Combustion Chain

## Executive Summary

Phasing out coal combustion at the pace required for climate targets requires: (1) no new coal plants globally from now; (2) OECD phase-out by 2030, global by 2040; (3) ~$150B/year in clean energy investment above current levels; (4) $30-50B/year in just transition funding; and (5) international cooperation to support developing country transitions. This is technically and economically feasible but requires unprecedented political will.
