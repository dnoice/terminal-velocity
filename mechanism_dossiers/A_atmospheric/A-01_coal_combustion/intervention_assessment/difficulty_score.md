# Difficulty Score: A-01 - Coal Combustion Chain

## Overall Assessment

**Score: 7/10** (High Difficulty)

**Classification:** Technically feasible, economically beneficial, but politically and socially contested

**Trend:** Declining difficulty (was 8/10 five years ago, likely 6/10 in five years)

---

## 1. Score Justification

### 1.1 Summary Rationale

Coal phase-out scores 7/10 difficulty because:

| Factor | Assessment | Impact on Score |
|--------|------------|-----------------|
| Technical alternatives exist | Lowers difficulty | -2 |
| Economic case is strong | Lowers difficulty | -1 |
| Concentrated political opposition | Raises difficulty | +3 |
| Infrastructure lock-in | Raises difficulty | +2 |
| Scale of transformation | Raises difficulty | +2 |
| International coordination needed | Raises difficulty | +2 |
| Precedents exist | Lowers difficulty | -1 |

**Net Assessment:** The technical and economic case is settled; the challenge is political and social.

### 1.2 Why Not Lower?

- **Not 6 or below:** Political resistance remains intense in key countries (China, India, USA, Australia). 2,400 GW of assets and 5 million jobs create powerful vested interests. International coordination is imperfect.

### 1.3 Why Not Higher?

- **Not 8 or above:** Alternatives are proven and increasingly cheaper. Multiple countries have achieved phase-out. Economic case is overwhelming. Trend favors decline.

## 2. Dimensional Scoring

### 2.1 Technical Feasibility

**Score: 3/10** (Low Difficulty - Feasible)

| Factor | Assessment | Score |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Alternative technologies | Proven, commercial | 2 |
| Grid integration | Solved with storage | 3 |
| Industrial replacement | Emerging solutions | 5 |
| Infrastructure scale | Massive but manageable | 4 |
| Timeline feasibility | Challenging but possible | 3 |

**Justification:** Solar, wind, and storage are mature technologies. Grid integration challenges have known solutions. Industrial coal (steel, cement) is harder but represents minority of use.

### 2.2 Economic Difficulty

**Score: 4/10** (Moderate-Low Difficulty)

| Factor | Assessment | Score |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Alternative cost | Already cheaper | 2 |
| Investment availability | Sufficient globally | 3 |
| Stranded assets | Significant but manageable | 6 |
| Transition costs | Large but smaller than benefits | 4 |
| Return on investment | Highly positive | 2 |

**Justification:** Renewables are now the cheapest form of new electricity in most of the world. The economic case for phase-out is overwhelming when externalities are counted. Challenge is stranded asset politics, not real economics.

### 2.3 Political Difficulty

**Score: 9/10** (Very High Difficulty)

| Factor | Assessment | Score |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Lobby power | Strong and organized | 9 |
| Electoral geography | Concentrated in key districts | 8 |
| International coordination | Difficult | 8 |
| Policy reversal risk | Significant | 7 |
| Regulatory capture | Widespread | 8 |

**Justification:** Despite economic headwinds, coal industry retains political power through lobbying, campaign contributions, and electoral geography. Key swing states/regions depend on coal. International free-rider problems persist.

### 2.4 Social Difficulty

**Score: 7/10** (High Difficulty)

| Factor | Assessment | Score |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Employment displacement | 5 million direct jobs | 7 |
| Community dependence | 500+ coal towns | 8 |
| Identity/culture | Strong attachment | 8 |
| Trust deficit | Significant | 7 |
| Just transition capacity | Underdeveloped | 6 |

**Justification:** Coal is not just a job but an identity for millions. Past transitions have been traumatic. Trust in transition promises is low. Just transition frameworks exist but are underfunded.

### 2.5 Institutional Difficulty

**Score: 6/10** (Moderate-High Difficulty)

| Factor | Assessment | Score |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Infrastructure turnover | Slow but accelerating | 6 |
| Regulatory frameworks | Exist, need strengthening | 5 |
| International institutions | Weak but improving | 7 |
| Finance system alignment | Improving | 5 |
| Knowledge/capacity | Generally sufficient | 4 |

**Justification:** Institutional frameworks for transition exist. Finance is increasingly aligned. Main challenges are the slow turnover of physical infrastructure and weak international enforcement.

## 4. Comparative Context

### 4.1 Comparison to Other Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Difficulty | Why Different |
|-----------|------------|---------------|
| A-01 Coal Combustion | 7/10 | Large scale, strong lobby, but alternatives ready |

## 8. Scoring Methodology

### 8.1 Scoring Criteria

| Score | Interpretation | Examples |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| 1-2 | Very Easy | Technical fixes, no opposition |
| 3-4 | Easy | Solutions available, limited opposition |
| 5-6 | Moderate | Trade-offs, organized but manageable opposition |
| 7-8 | Hard | Significant barriers, strong opposition |
| 9-10 | Very Hard | Fundamental conflicts, entrenched opposition |

### 8.2 Weighting

| Dimension | Weight | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Technical | 15% | Necessary but not sufficient |
| Economic | 20% | Key enabling factor |
| Political | 30% | Binding constraint currently |
| Social | 20% | Just transition essential |
| Institutional | 15% | Important but improving |

### 8.3 Weighted Calculation

```text
Weighted Score Calculation
──────────────────────────
Technical:    3/10 × 0.15 = 0.45
Economic:     4/10 × 0.20 = 0.80
Political:    9/10 × 0.30 = 2.70
Social:       7/10 × 0.20 = 1.40
Institutional: 6/10 × 0.15 = 0.90
──────────────────────────
TOTAL:                      6.25 → Round to 6/10

Note: Qualitative adjustment to 7/10 reflects:
- Geopolitical considerations
- Scale of transformation
- Uncertainty about political trajectory
```

## 9. Key Difficulty Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Overall difficulty score | 7/10 |
| Hardest dimension | Political (9/10) |
| Easiest dimension | Technical (3/10) |
| Trend direction | Declining |
| Estimated 2030 score | 5-6/10 |
| Countries achieving phase-out | 5+ (UK, etc.) |
| Countries with high difficulty | 10+ |
| Key binding constraint | Political will |

---

## 10. Conclusion

**Coal phase-out is hard (7/10) but getting easier.** The technical and economic barriers have largely fallen. The remaining challenges are political and social - overcoming entrenched interests, managing just transition, and coordinating internationally. With sustained effort, the difficulty will continue to decline as economics overwhelm politics. The question is no longer whether coal will end, but how quickly and how justly.
