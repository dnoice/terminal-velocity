# Geographic Scope: A-01 - Coal Combustion Chain

## Executive Summary

Coal combustion impacts span from localized point-source pollution at mine mouths and power plants to hemispheric atmospheric transport of mercury and particulates. China, India, and the United States remain the dominant actors, while atmospheric and climate impacts respect no borders.
