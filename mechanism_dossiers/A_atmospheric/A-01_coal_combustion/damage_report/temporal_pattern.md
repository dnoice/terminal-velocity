# Temporal Pattern: A-01 - Coal Combustion Chain

## Executive Summary

Coal's 250-year reign as industrial civilization's primary energy source is entering its terminal phase in developed economies while simultaneously peaking in developing nations. The temporal pattern reveals a dangerous lag between scientific understanding (1970s), policy response (2010s), and actual phase-out (2030s-2050s), during which cumulative damage continues to compound.
