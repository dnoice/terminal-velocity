# Code of Conduct

> *"The work is serious. Our conduct must match."*

---

## Our Standards

Terminal Velocity documents mechanisms of civilizational self-destruction. This requires:

- **Intellectual honesty** above ego
- **Evidence** above opinion
- **Precision** above speed
- **Collaboration** above competition
- **The record** above personal credit

### Expected Behavior

✅ Engage with evidence, not personalities  
✅ Cite sources for factual claims  
✅ Acknowledge uncertainty and limitations  
✅ Credit others' work appropriately  
✅ Accept good-faith criticism constructively  
✅ Prioritize accuracy over being right  
✅ Respect the gravity of the subject matter  

### Unacceptable Behavior

❌ Personal attacks or ad hominem arguments  
❌ Presenting opinion as fact  
❌ Fabricating or falsifying evidence  
❌ Plagiarism or uncredited appropriation  
❌ Harassment of any kind  
❌ Bad-faith engagement designed to derail  
❌ Doxxing or exposing private information  
❌ Using the project for partisan advocacy  

---

## Scope

This code applies to:

- All project spaces (GitHub, discussions, issues, PRs)
- Project-related communications
- Public representation of the project

---

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Report violations to: **[maintainer contact - to be added]**

Include:
- Description of the behavior
- Where/when it occurred
- Any relevant links or screenshots

Reports are confidential. Retaliation against reporters is itself a violation.

### Response

Maintainers will:

1. Acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. Investigate the report
3. Determine appropriate action
4. Communicate the outcome to relevant parties

### Consequences

Depending on severity:

| Level | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **Warning** | Private notice, expected behavior change |
| **Temporary Ban** | Removal from project spaces for defined period |
| **Permanent Ban** | Permanent removal from all project spaces |

Fabrication or falsification of evidence results in immediate permanent ban. This is a forensic project—integrity is non-negotiable.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1, with modifications appropriate to a research documentation project.

---

## The Point

We are building a permanent record of preventable destruction. The people affected by these mechanisms deserve better than petty drama from those documenting their suffering.

Act like the work matters. Because it does.
